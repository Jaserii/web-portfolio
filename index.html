            Hello! Thank you for taking the time to preview my portfolio! My name is Ralph Terte and I am currently a fourth year
            student at Brock University in Canada and I am working towards an Honours Bachelor of Science
            in Computer Science with a Concentration in Software Engineering. 
            <br><br>
            Within the four years at Brock University, I had learned numerous concepts and languages:
            <ul>
                <li>Object-Oriented Programming: Java, C#, Python</li>
                <li>Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                <li>Data Structures: Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc. </li>
                <li>Algorithms: Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms </li>
            </ul>
            I have previously completed three co-op experiences; a mix between federal and provincial government
            positions. Within those positions, I had developed the following skills:
            <ul>
                <li>SharePoint Design and Administration Skills</li>
                <li>Experience in Microsoft Azure Services such as Entra/Azure AD and Azure AI Services </li>
